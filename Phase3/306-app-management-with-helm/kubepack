=== Deployment: Kubepack

This section will explain how to use https://kubepack.com/[Kubepack] to deploy your Kubernetes application.

. Install `kubepack` CLI:

  wget -O pack https://github.com/kubepack/pack/releases/download/0.1.0/pack-darwin-amd64 \
    && chmod +x pack \
    && sudo mv pack /usr/local/bin/

. Move to package root directory: `cd apps/k8s/kubepack`
. Pull dependent packages:
+
  pack dep -f .
+
This will generate `manifests/vendor` folder.
+
. Generate final manifests: Combine the manifests for this package and its dependencies and potential patches into the final manifests:
+
  pack up -f .
+
This will create `manifests/output` folder with an installer script and final manifests.
+
. Install package: `./manifests/output/install.sh`
. Access the application:

  curl http://$(kubectl get svc/webapp -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')

. Delete the application: `kubectl delete -R -f manifests/output`
