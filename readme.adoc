= Introduce Tech Summit Kubernetes Hands-on Lab
:toc:

These days, container services are being considered in various sectors to be operated at the production level thanks to its fast and easy deployment. Having said that, enterprise customers are also participating in the adoption of container services when implementing a development environment, although it is still in limited use cases. However, it is commonly regarded that, to be used as a service in the production environment, container services cause operational difficulties due to high technical obstacles and operation burden.

Several reasons are being observed for such perception. First, the absence of a proper operation tool. There are too many orchestration and operation tools, but for enterprise-level services, it is still unclear what would be an easy and reliable tool for stable service. Second, an application structure that does not consider the container environment. Generally, legacy application structure is converted into docker images for deployment. Finally, monitoring and debugging are a pain. Due to the nature of container services, a single service is distributed to multiple instances; in the MSA structure where multiple services are related to each other, debugging and logging become more complex.

Concerns of enterprise customers are not limited to the operation of container services, but also include network and storage management, configuration management and services for multi-Region deployment, and security. There is a high demand for a one-step guideline or hands-on material that cover all technical matters.

== Read first : Description of the overall hands-on lab structure and objectives
Hands-on Lab has contained Three phases and Pre Lab. Pre Lab explain full context of Hands-on lab with advance preparation as like the content of this article you are already reading.

== Pre-Lab0 - Build basic environment for operation 
This section walks you through the creating a Kubernetes development environment using https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/[AWS Cloud9].  This will provide you with a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that will let you write, run, and debug containerized workloads using just a web browser.

== Create AWS Cloud9 Environment
=== AWS Cloud9 Console

We can create the Cloud9 development environment via CloudFormation.
This CloudFormation template will spin up the Cloud9 IDE, as well as configure the IDE environment for the rest of the workshop.

The CloudFormation template can create a new VPC, or you can choose an existing VPC if needed.
If you are unsure, we recommend the "Launch template with an existing VPC" option.

Click on the "Deploy to AWS" button and follow the CloudFormation prompts to begin.

[NOTE]
AWS Cloud9 is currently available in 5 regions, and EKS is currently available in 2 regions (us-east-1 and us-west-2).
Please choose the region closest to you.  If you choose a region for Cloud9 that does not support EKS, you need to create VPC resources and change environment variables. This configuration has not been tested.

|===

|Region | Launch template with a new VPC | Launch template with an existing VPC
| *N. Virginia* (us-east-1)
a| image::./imgs/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=k8s-workshop&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/lab-ide-vpc.template]
a| image::./imgs/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=k8s-workshop&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/lab-ide-novpc.template]

| *Oregon* (us-west-2)
a| image::./imgs/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=k8s-workshop&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/lab-ide-vpc.template]
a| image::./imgs/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=k8s-workshop&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/lab-ide-novpc.template]

|===

Accept the default stack name and Click *Next*. You can give Tags such as Key=Name, Value=k8s-workshop, and click *Next*. Make sure
to check *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names* and click *Create*.

CloudFormation creates nested stacks and builds several resources that are required for this workshop. Wait until all the resources are created. Once the status for *k8s-workshop* changes to *CREATE_COMPLETE*,
you can open Cloud9 IDE. To open the Cloud9 IDE environment, click on the "Outputs" tab in CloudFormation Console and click on the "Cloud9IDE" URL.

image:./imgs/cloudformation-output-tab.png[CloudFormation Output Tab]

You should see an environment similar to this:

image:./imgs/cloud9-development-environment-welcome.png[]

=== Cloud9 Instance Role

The Cloud9 IDE needs to use the assigned IAM Instance profile. Open the "AWS Cloud9" menu, go to "Preferences", go to "AWS Settings", and disable "AWS managed temporary credentials" as depicted in the diagram here:

image:./imgs/cloud9-disable-temp-credentials.png[]

=== Build Script

Once your Cloud9 is ready, download the build script and install in your IDE. This will prepare your IDE for running tutorials in this workshop. The build script installs the following:

- jq
- kubectl _(the Kubernetes CLI, which we'll cover in great detail later in the workshop)_
- heptio/authenticator _(for authentication to the EKS cluster)_
- updates/configures the AWS CLI and stores necessary environment variables in bash_profile
- kops _(Kubernetes Operations, which we'll also cover in detail later)_
- creates an SSH key
- clone the workshop repository into Cloud9

To install the script, run this command in the "bash" terminal tab of the Cloud9 IDE:

    aws s3 cp s3://aws-kubernetes-artifacts/v0.5/lab-ide-build.sh . && \
    chmod +x lab-ide-build.sh && \
    . ./lab-ide-build.sh

image:./imgs/cloud9-run-script.png[Running the script in Cloud9 Terminal]


At this point you can restart the Cloud9 IDE terminal session to ensure that the kubectl completion is enabled. Once a new terminal window is opened, type `kubectl ver` and press `Tab` to autocomplete and press `Enter`. This will ensure that the `kubectl` tool is installed on the command line correctly and can autocomplete.

[NOTE]
All shell commands _(starting with "$")_ throughout the rest of the workshop should be run in this tab. You may want to resize it upwards to make it larger.

You are now ready to continue on with the workshop!


== Pre-Lab1 - Technical Fundamental Hardning - Build and Deploy Container as MSA

To ensure the docker container deploy operation. Please take this lab. 
The lab contains a simple application that consists of three microservices. The sample application uses three services:

. `webapp`: Web application microservice calls `greeting` and `name` microservice to generate a greeting for a person.
. `greeting`: A microservice that returns a greeting.
. `name`: A microservice that returns a person’s name based upon `{id}` in the URL.

Each application is deployed using different AWS Compute options.

개발 단계에서 어플리케이션을 설계하고 도커라이징 할 때 고려해 할 사항

=== Cloud9 의 자바 환경 구성 및 Maven 설치
This sample enables you to run some Java code in an AWS Cloud9 development environment.

Creating this sample might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for services such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.

==== Step1: Install Required Tools
In this step, you install a set of Java development tools in your AWS Cloud9 development environment. If you already have a set of Java development tools such as the Oracle JDK or OpenJDK installed in your environment, you can skip ahead to Step 2: Add Code. This sample was developed with OpenJDK 8, which you can install in your environment by completing the following procedure.

1. Confirm whether OpenJDK 8 is already installed. To do this, in a terminal session in the AWS Cloud9 IDE, run the command line version of the Java runner with the -version option. (To start a new terminal session, on the menu bar, choose Window, New Terminal.)

  $ java -version

Based on the output of the preceding command, do one of the following:

* If the output states that the java command isn't found, continue with step 2 in this procedure to install OpenJDK 8.
* If the output contains values starting with Java(TM), Java Runtime Environment, Java SE, J2SE, or Java2, the OpenJDK isn't installed or isn't set as the default Java development toolset. Continue with step 2 in this procedure to install OpenJDK 8, and then switch to using OpenJDK 8.
* If the output contains values starting with java version 1.8 and OpenJDK, skip ahead to Step 2: Add Code. OpenJDK 8 is installed correctly for this sample.
* If the output contains a java version less than 1.8 and values starting with OpenJDK, continue with step 2 in this procedure to upgrade the installed OpenJDK version to OpenJDK 8.

2. Ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed. To do this, run the yum tool with the update command.

  $ sudo yum -y update

3. Install OpenJDK 8. To do this, run the yum tool with the install command, specifying the OpenJDK 8 package.

  $ sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

4. Switch or upgrade the default Java development toolset to OpenJDK 8. To do this, run the update-alternatives command with the --config option. Run this command twice to switch or upgrade the command line versions of the Java runner and compiler.

  $ sudo update-alternatives --config java
  $ sudo update-alternatives --config javac

At each prompt, type the selection number for OpenJDK 8 (the one that contains java-1.8).

5. Confirm that the command line versions of the Java runner and compiler are using OpenJDK 8. To do this, run the command line versions of the Java runner and compiler with the -version option.

  $ java -version
  $ javac -version

If OpenJDK 8 is installed and set correctly, the Java runner version output contains a value starting with openjdk version 1.8, and the Java compiler version output starts with the value javac 1.8.

==== Step 2: Set Up to Use the AWS SDK for Java
You can enhance this sample to use the AWS SDK for Java to create an Amazon S3 bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created.

In this step, you install Apache Maven or Gradle in your environment. Maven and Gradle are common build automation systems that can be used with Java projects. After you install Maven or Gradle, you use it to generate a new Java project. In this new project, you add a reference to the AWS SDK for Java. This AWS SDK for Java provides a convenient way to interact with AWS services such as Amazon S3, from your Java code.

===== Set Up with Maven 
1. Install Maven in your environment. To see whether Maven is already installed, using the terminal in the AWS Cloud9 IDE, run Maven with the -version option.

  $ mvn -version

If successful, the output contains the Maven version number. If Maven is already installed, skip ahead to step 4 in this procedure to use Maven to generate a new Java project in your environment.

2. Install Maven by using the terminal to run the following commands. These commands get information about the package repository where Maven is stored, and then use this information to install Maven.

  $ sudo wget http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
  $ sudo sed -i s/\$releasever/6/g /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
  $ sudo yum install -y apache-maven

3. Confirm the installation by running Maven with the -version option.

  $ mvn -version

=== Build and Test Services using Maven

. Each microservice is in a different repo:
+
[cols="1,3"]
|====
| `greeting` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-greeting
| `name` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-name
| `webapp` | https://github.com/arun-gupta/microservices-webapp
|====
+
. Clone all the repos. Open each one in a separate terminal.
. Run `greeting` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test: `curl http://localhost:8081/resources/greeting`
. Run `name` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
.. Optionally test:
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names`
... `curl http://localhost:8082/resources/names/1`
. Run `webapp` service: `mvn wildfly-swarm:run`
. Run the application: `curl http://localhost:8080/`

=== Create Docker Images

`mvn package -Pdocker` for each repo will create the Docker image.

By default, the Docker image name is `arungupta/<service>` where `<service>` is `greeting`, `name` or `webapp`. The image can be created in your repo:

  mvn package -Pdocker -Ddocker.repo=<repo>

By default, the `latest` tag is used for the image. A different tag may be specified as:

  mvn package -Pdocker -Ddocker.tag=<tag>

=== Running Docker container from local repository

  $ Docker run -d -p 8081:8081 arungupta/greeting
  $ curl http://localhost:8081/resources/greeting

=== Push Docker Images to Registry

IAM Role 에 EC2ContainerRepository 권한 부여 


ECS 에 Docker 를 배포하기 위하여 ECR 레포지토리를 생성 

  $ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name yjeong-greeting

Docker 이미지를 ECR 에 푸싱 하기 위하여 태깅

  $ Docker tag 

Push Docker images to the registry:

  mvn install -Pdocker

==== Debug

. List stack:

  docker stack ls

. List services in the stack:

  docker stack services myapp

. List containers:

  docker container ls -f name=myapp*

. Get logs for all the containers in the `webapp` service:

  docker service logs myapp_webapp-service

=== Deployment: Create Cluster using AWS Console

This section will explain how to create an ECS cluster using AWS Console.

Complete instructions are available at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create_cluster.html.

Use the cluster name `fargate-cluster`.

=== Deployment: Create Cluster using AWS CloudFormation

This section will explain how to create an ECS cluster using CloudFormation.

The following resources are needed in order to deploy the sample application:

- Private Application Load Balancer for `greeting` and `name` and a public ALB for `webapp`
- Target groups registered with the ALB
- Security Group that allows the services to talk to each other and be externally accessible

. Create an ECS cluster with these resources:

  cd apps/ecs/fargate/templates
  aws cloudformation deploy \
    --stack-name fargate-cluster \
    --template-file infrastructure.yaml \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

. View the output from the cluster:

  aws cloudformation \
    describe-stacks \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --stack-name fargate-cluster \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs[]' \
    --output text

==== Deployment: Simple ECS Cluster

This section explains how to create a ECS cluster with no additional resources. The cluster can be created with a private VPC or a public VPC. The CloudFormation templates for different types are available at https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/tree/master/aws/services/ECS/EC2LaunchType/clusters.

This section will create a 3-instance cluster using a public VPC:

  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/master/aws/services/ECS/EC2LaunchType/clusters/public-vpc.yml
  aws cloudformation deploy \
    --stack-name MyECSCluster \
    --template-file public-vpc.yml \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

List the cluster using `aws ecs list-clusters` command:

  {
      "clusterArns": [
          "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:091144949931:cluster/MyECSCluster-ECSCluster-197YNE1ZHPSOP"
      ]
  }

=== Deployment: Create Cluster and Deploy Services using Fargate CLI

This section explains how to create a Fargate cluster and run services on it.

. Download CLI from http://somanymachines.com/fargate/
. Create the LoadBalancer:

  fargate lb create \
    microservices-lb \
    --port 80

. Create `greeting` service:

  fargate service create greeting-service \
    --lb microservices-lb \
    -m 1024 \
    -i <ECR Docker Image URI>\
    -p http:8081 \
    --rule path=/resources/greeting

. Create `name` service:

  fargate service create name-service \
    --lb microservices-lb \
    -m 1024 \
    -i <ECR Docker Image URI>\
    -p http:8082 \
    --rule path=/resources/names/*

. Get URL of the LoadBalancer:

  fargate lb info microservices-lb

. Create `webapp` service:

  fargate service create webapp-service \
    --lb microservices-lb \
    -m 1024 \
    -i <ECR Docker Image URI> \
    -p http:8080 \
    -e GREETING_SERVICE_HOST=<lb> \
    -e GREETING_SERVICE_PORT=80 \
    -e GREETING_SERVICE_PATH=/resources/greeting \
    -e NAME_SERVICE_HOST=<lb> \
    -e NAME_SERVICE_PORT=80 \
    -e NAME_SERVICE_PATH=/resources/names

. Test the application:

  curl http://<lb>
  curl http://<lb>/0

. Scale the service: `fargate service scale webapp-service +3`
. Clean up the resources:

  fargate service scale greeting-service 0
  fargate service scale name-service 0
  fargate service scale webapp-service 0
  fargate lb destroy microservices-lb

NOTE: As described at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service_limits.html, the number of tasks using the Fargate launch type, per region, per account is 20. This limit can be increased by filing a support ticket from the AWS Console.

=== Deployment: Deploy Tasks and Service using ECS CLI

This section will explain how to create an ECS cluster using a CloudFormation template. The tasks are then deployed using ECS CLI and Docker Compose definitions.

==== Pre-requisites

. Install https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_CLI.html[ECS CLI].
. Install - https://www.perl.org/get.html[Perl].

==== Deploy the application

. Run the CloudFormation template to create the AWS resources:
+
|===
|Region | Launch Template
| *N. Virginia* (us-east-1)
a| image::./images/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=aws-microservices-deploy-options-ecscli&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-microservices-deploy-options/infra.yaml]
|===
+
. Run the follow command to capture the output from the CloudFormation template as key/value pairs in the file `ecs-cluster.props`. These will be used to setup environment variables which are used subseqently.

    aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
      --stack-name aws-microservices-deploy-options-ecscli \
      --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' \
      --output=text | \
      perl -lpe 's/\s+/=/g' | \
      tee ecs-cluster.props

. Setup the environment variables using this file:

    set -o allexport
    source ecs-cluster.props
    set +o allexport

. Configure ECS CLI:

    ecs-cli configure --cluster $ECSCluster --region us-east-1 --default-launch-type FARGATE

. Create the task definition parameters for each of the service:

    ecs-params-create.sh greeting
    ecs-params-create.sh name
    ecs-params-create.sh webapp

. Start the `greeting` service up:

    ecs-cli compose --verbose \
      --file greeting-docker-compose.yaml \
      --task-role-arn $ECSRole \
      --ecs-params ecs-params_greeting.yaml \
      --project-name greeting \
      service up \
      --target-group-arn $GreetingTargetGroupArn \
      --container-name greeting-service \
      --container-port 8081

. Bring the `name` service up:

    ecs-cli compose --verbose \
      --file name-docker-compose.yaml \
      --task-role-arn $ECSRole \
      --ecs-params ecs-params_name.yaml  \
      --project-name name \
      service up \
      --target-group-arn $NameTargetGroupArn \
      --container-name name-service \
      --container-port 8082

. Bring the webapp service up:
+
    ecs-cli compose --verbose \
      --file webapp-docker-compose.yaml \
      --task-role-arn $ECSRole \
      --ecs-params ecs-params_webapp.yaml \
      --project-name webapp \
      service up \
      --target-group-arn $WebappTargetGroupArn \
      --container-name webapp-service \
      --container-port 8080
+
Docker Compose supports environment variable substitution. The `webapp-docker-compose.yaml` uses `$PrivateALBCName`  to refer to the private Application Load Balancer for `greeting` and `name` service.
+
. Check the `healthy` status of different services:

    aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
      --target-group-arn $GreetingTargetGroupArn \
      --query 'TargetHealthDescriptions[0].TargetHealth.State' \
      --output text
    aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
      --target-group-arn $NameTargetGroupArn \
      --query 'TargetHealthDescriptions[0].TargetHealth.State' \
      --output text
    aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
      --target-group-arn $WebappTargetGroupArn \
      --query 'TargetHealthDescriptions[0].TargetHealth.State' \
      --output text

. Once all the services are in `healthy` state, get a response from the `webapp` service:

  curl http://"$ALBPublicCNAME"
  Hello Sheldon

==== Tear down the resources

  ecs-cli compose --verbose \
        --file greeting-docker-compose.yaml \
        --task-role-arn $ECSRole \
        --ecs-params ecs-params_greeting.yaml \
        --project-name greeting \
        service down
  ecs-cli compose --verbose \
        --file name-docker-compose.yaml \
        --task-role-arn $ECSRole \
        --ecs-params ecs-params_name.yaml \
        --project-name name \
        service down
  ecs-cli compose --verbose \
        --file webapp-docker-compose.yaml \
        --task-role-arn $ECSRole \
        --ecs-params ecs-params_webapp.yaml \
        --project-name webapp \
        service down
  aws cloudformation delete-stack --region us-east-1 --stack-name aws-microservices-deploy-options-ecscli

=== Deployment: Create Cluster and Deploy Fargate Tasks using CloudFormation

This section creates an ECS cluster and deploys Fargate tasks to the cluster:

|===
|Region | Launch Template
| *N. Virginia* (us-east-1)
a| image::./images/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=aws-compute-options-fargate&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/compute-options-public/master.yaml]

=== Deployment: Create Cluster and Deploy EC2 Tasks using CloudFormation

This section creates an ECS cluster and deploys EC2 tasks to the cluster:

|===
|Region | Launch Template
| *N. Virginia* (us-east-1)
a| image::./images/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=aws-compute-options-ecs&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-compute-options-bucket/master.yaml]
|===

Retrieve the public endpoint to test your application deployment:

  aws cloudformation \
    describe-stacks \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --stack-name aws-compute-options-ecs \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs[?OutputKey==`PublicALBCNAME`].[OutputValue]' \
    --output text

Use the command to test:

  curl http://<public_endpoint>

=== Deployment Pipeline: Fargate with AWS CodePipeline

This section will explain how to deploy a Fargate task via CodePipeline

. Fork each of the repositories in the link:#build-and-test-services-using-maven[Build and Test Services using Maven] section.
. Clone the forked repositories to your local machine:

  git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/microservice-greeting
  git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/microservice-name
  git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/microservice-webapp

. Create the CloudFormation stack:
+
|===
|Region | Launch Template
| *N. Virginia* (us-east-1)
a| image::./images/deploy-to-aws.png[link=https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?stackName=Fargate-ContinuousDeployment&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-microservices-deploy-options-ecs-deployment/ecs-refarch-continuous-deployment.yaml&param_LaunchType=Fargate]
|===

The CloudFormation template requires the following input parameters:

. Cluster Configuration
.. *Launch Type:* Select Fargate.
. GitHub Configuration
.. *Repo:* The repository name for each of the sample services. These have been populated for you.
.. *Branch:* The branch of the repository to deploy continuously, e.g. master.
.. *User:* Your GitHub username.
.. *Personal Access Token:* A token for the user specified above. Use https://github.com/settings/tokens to create a new token. See https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.12/user/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/[Creating a personal access token for the command line] for more details.

The CloudFormation stack has the following outputs:

. *ServiceUrl:* The URL of the sample service that is being deployed.
. *PipelineUrl:* A deep link for the pipeline in the AWS Management Console.

Once the stack has been provisioned, *click* the link for the *PipelineUrl*. This will open the CodePipline console.  Clicking on the pipeline will display a diagram that looks like this:

image::./images/fargate-pipeline.png[Fargate Pipeline, 350]

Now that a deployment pipeline has been established for our services, you can modify files in the repositories we cloned earlier and push your changes to GitHub.  This will cause the following actions to occur:

. The latest changes will be pulled from GitHub.
. A new Docker image will be created and pushed to ECR.
. A new revision of the task definition will be created using the latest version of the Docker image.
. The service definition will be updated with the latest version of the task definition.
. ECS will deploy a new version of the Fargate task.

==== Cleaning up the example resources

To remove all the resources created by the example, do the following:

. Delete the main CloudFromation stack which deletes the sub stacks and resouces.
. Manually delete the resources which may contain content:
.. S3 Bucket: ArtifactBucket
.. ECR Repository: Repository
